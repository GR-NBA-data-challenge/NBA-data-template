# This is the main function you are requested to define.
# required_predictions: a list of matches that you should predict
# data_loader: a NbaDataLoader class instance.
#     Contains getSeason, getGame and getPlayers methods. Please refer to simulate.py for details about
#     the provided methods.
# log: you can call log('message') to log any information you want. These messages are automatically
#     printed to console, and to the logfiles when running on the server side.
#     All logs sent to this logger can be retrieved from our servers (up to a maximum size), so
#     use this to debug issues when running your code in our simulations.
# (return): You should return, for each match requested in required_predictions, two numbers:
#     The difference between the scores: homeScore - awayScore
#     And the sum of the scores: homeScore - awayScore
